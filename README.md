# First-Face Casino Simulator

A lightweight web-based simulator for the First Face casino game. Place number bets, watch the shoe reveal cards, and track payouts and long-term house edge in real time.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
2. Select a chip denomination from the chip rack, then click any numbered spot (2–10) on the playmat to stack chips and place bets.
3. Press **Deal Hand** to play out a shoe until the first face card (J/Q/K/A) or the Joker appears.
4. Hits on your chosen number pay according to the four-step ladder (4×, 6×, 14×, 100×). Each chip remains in place and is forfeited when the hand stops.
5. Use **Clear Bets** before dealing to pick your chips back up, or **New Hand** after a hand resolves to reset the table. The stats panel summarises hands played, total wagered, total paid, and the running house edge.

The simulator always uses a freshly shuffled 53-card deck for each hand, matching the rules provided.
