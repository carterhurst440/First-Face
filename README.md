# First-Face Casino Simulator

A lightweight web-based simulator for the First Face casino game. Place number bets, watch the shoe reveal cards, and track payouts and long-term house edge in real time.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
2. Choose a number (2–10), enter the units you want to wager, and press **Add Bet**.
3. Press **Deal Hand** to play out a shoe until the first face card (J/Q/K/A) or the Joker appears.
4. Hits on your chosen number pay according to the four-step ladder (4×, 6×, 14×, 100×). The original wager remains on the felt and is lost when the hand ends.
5. Use **New Hand** to clear the table and bet again. The stats panel summarises hands played, total wagered, total paid, and the running house edge.

The simulator always uses a freshly shuffled 53-card deck for each hand, matching the rules provided.
